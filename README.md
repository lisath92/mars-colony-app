# MarsColonyApp2

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.10.

##About
This is a single page application that emulates colonists on Mars without reloading the browser. We were provided with API keys which allowed us to use the methods POST and GET. This project is intended to let us familiarize ourselves with using Angular 2 as the JavaScript framework.

##Tools and Methods Used
Angular 2 - framework we used to generate a single page application that does not reload the browser when users click into different views. We used the built in methods to bind data to certain HTML elements. For example, in the colonist check-in component, a select element uses angular method to get a list of occupations for users to choose from.
HTML5 & SCSS - to generate styles of the app

##General Overview
I found this to be quite challenging at first since the concept of Angular 2 is different from what we have done before. The idea was harder to grasp, but after building out the components required for this project, I found this framework to be very useful. Using Angular-cli as part of our developer tools made me realize the importance of having the correct dev tools for every project. In the future, I would use this framework to build out SPAs or for more complex forms.
