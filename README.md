# MarsColonyApp2

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.10.

##About
This is a single page application that emulates colonists on Mars without reloading the browser. We were provided with API keys which generate 2 lists: one of occupations colonists can choose from in the check-in view and one of aliens in the reporting an alien encounter view. This project is intended to let us familiarize ourselves with using Angular 2 as the JavaScript framework.

##Tools and Methods Used
Angular 2 - framework we used to generate a single page application that does not reload the browser when uses click into different views. We used the built in methods to bind data onto the HTML and generate directly onto the view from there.
HTML5 & SCSS - to generate styles of the app

##General Overview
I found this to be quite challenging at first since the concept of Angular 2 is different from what we have done before. The idea was harder to grasp, but after building out the components required for this project, I found this framework to be very useful. Angular-cli allows the server to combine all the files together without extra work. In the future, I would use this framework to build out SPAs or for more complex forms.
